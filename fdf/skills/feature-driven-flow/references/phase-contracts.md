# Phase Contracts

## Input Contract

1. Feature request text.
2. Project root path.
3. Constraints.
4. Non-goals.
5. Change concerns required by active rules.
6. Rule selection context:
   - inferred execution context summary and confidence
   - inferred context-model fields (strictness/change_type/system_shape/delivery_surface/optional compliance + flags)
   - matrix candidate input mode (`file|inline|none`) and source reference
   - compiled instructions candidate mode (`bundle|compact|none`) and content mode (`reference|portable|hybrid|none`) and source reference
   - imported custom instructions disposition (`accept|edit|discard|none`) and confirmation state
   - candidate validation result and normalization notes (if applicable)
   - matrix export mode (`auto|on-demand|none`) and target path policy from settings
   - compiled instructions export mode (`auto|on-demand|none`), format (`bundle|compact`), and content mode (`reference|portable|hybrid`)
   - custom instructions export decision (`include|skip`), approval status (`approved|pending|none`), and approved/skipped item counts
   - selected profiles (if any) and profile overrides
   - selected shared rules
   - selected repository-local rules
   - user confirmation or adjustment of Effective Rule Matrix

## Output Contract by Phase

1. Scope:
   - outputs defined by active Scope-phase rules
2. Explore:
   - outputs defined by active Explore-phase rules
3. Clarify:
   - outputs defined by active Clarify-phase rules
4. Architect:
   - outputs defined by active Architect-phase rules
5. Implement:
   - outputs defined by active Implement-phase rules
6. Verify:
   - outputs defined by active Verify-phase rules
7. Summarize:
   - outputs defined by active Summarize-phase rules

## Structured Output Requirement

Each phase response should include this lightweight structure:

1. `phase`: phase name.
2. `inputs`: key context used.
3. `outputs`: phase-specific results.
4. `applied_rules`: rules applied in this phase.
5. `checklist_results`: derived checklist items from active rule `checks`, with `passed|blocked|n/a` and evidence.
6. `decision_log`: decisions made, rationale, owner.
7. `risk_register`: active risks, severity, mitigation, status.
8. `artifacts`: templates or artifacts produced in this phase.
9. `traceability`: requirement -> rules -> artifacts/files/tests mapping.
10. `open_questions`: unresolved items, if any.
11. `gate_status`: `blocked|ready`.

## Hard Stop Conditions

1. Missing user approval for implementation.
2. Open critical ambiguity in requirements.
3. Verify phase not performed.
