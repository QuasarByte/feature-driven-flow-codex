## intent
Close work with high-confidence findings and explicit user disposition.

## guidance
### verify
1. If no explicit diff/range is provided, default audit scope to current working diff.
2. Run parallel audit passes where possible.
3. Consolidate findings into blocking and material groups.
4. Attach confidence per issue.
5. Report high-confidence findings by default (confidence >= 80).
6. Keep lower-confidence notes out unless user asks for them.
7. Ask user disposition: fix now, defer, or proceed.

## checks
### verify
1. Findings are severity-ranked.
2. Confidence is explicit.
3. Default report set is high-confidence unless user requested broader coverage.
4. Audit scope (explicit or default) is recorded.
5. User disposition is recorded.

## outputs
### verify
1. Consolidated findings report.
2. Confidence and remediation summary.
3. Smallest safe correction plan.
4. Residual uncertainty summary when no findings.
5. Disposition decision log.
